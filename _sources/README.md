## Abstract
This study investigates the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mobility patterns in the United States using Google Community Mobility Reports. The research employs descriptive statistics, time-series analysis, and regression models to analyze the data. In order to understand the mechanism of epidemic spread on the community mobility, we modelled the demand-service relationship using the DQQ model which analyze disruptions and recoveries in complex systems in different contexts. The model can help decision-makers and practitioners develop strategies to mitigate the impact of disruptions, improve the resilience of systems, and enhance the recovery process. Furthermore, the model can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of different policies and interventions aimed at minimizing disruptions and accelerating the recovery process. The analysis results indicate significant changes in mobility patterns during the pandemic, with notable variations across different regions and sectors. The findings have implications for policymakers and future research on the long-term consequences of the pandemic on human mobility.
